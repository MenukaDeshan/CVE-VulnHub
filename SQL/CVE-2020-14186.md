# SQL Injection (CVE-2020-14186)

SQL Injection is a type of vulnerability that can occur when user input is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, and potential execution of malicious SQL statements.

Here's an example of how SQL Injection can occur:

```sql
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";

$result = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);

```

In this example, the user input from $_POST['username'] and $_POST['password'] are directly used in the SQL query without any sanitization. If a malicious user enters ' OR 1=1 -- as the username, the resulting SQL query will become:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --' AND password = '$password'
```

This will return all rows from the users table because the OR 1=1 condition is always true, and the -- comments out the rest of the query. The $password is not used in this query, so it doesn't matter what the actual password is.

To prevent SQL Injection, user input should always be properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. This can be done using prepared statements or by using parameterized queries with bind variables.

Here's an example of using prepared statements with PDO:

```sql
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->execute([$username, $password]);
$result = $stmt->fetchAll();
```
In this example, the ? placeholders are used to represent the parameters, and the execute() method is used to bind the parameters to the placeholders. This ensures that the user input is properly sanitized and cannot be used to inject malicious SQL statements.

It's important to note that SQL Injection can occur in any part of the application where user input is used in SQL queries, including search queries, filter conditions, and more. Regular input validation and sanitization should be implemented to prevent this type of vulnerability.
